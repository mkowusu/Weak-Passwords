# Weak-Passwords

The object of this programming exercise is to develop an application program, in the C programming language, 
to determine whether any of the login passwords on a slightly old-fashioned multiuser Unix or Linux system are weak -- in
particular, whether any of them is a password that is known to be in very common use and hence easily guessed. The 
program should take a command-line argument specifying the file containing the records of the users' accounts. It should 
output the usernames (and only the usernames) associated with the passwords that it guesses.
